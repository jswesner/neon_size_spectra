siteCode,character string of four (4) letter site identifier
repID,"alphanumeric identifier of replicate takes value ""R#"" (e.g., R2) for each rep. sample replicates split among more than one tin are separated by a point (.) (e.g., R1.2)"
tinID,"alphanumeric code for weighing tin identification. Format: TXXX (e.g., T001)"
tinmass_mg,"numeric value of tin weight in milligrams (e.g., 1023.8 mg). Optional and may be empty"
