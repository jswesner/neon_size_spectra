DATA PRODUCT INFORMATION
------------------------

ID: NEON.DOM.SITE.DP1.20120.001

Name: Macroinvertebrate collection

Description: Collection of benthic macroinvertebrates using multiple sampling methods in lakes, rivers, and wadeable streams

NEON Science Team Supplier: Aquatic Observation System

Abstract: This data product contains the quality-controlled, native sampling resolution data from NEON's aquatic macroinvertebrate collection and field metadata, as well as associated taxonomic, morphometric, and count analyses data provided by a contracted lab. Benthic field samples are collected in wadeable streams, rivers, and lakes three times per year during the growing season using the type of sampler most suitable to the habitat types present at the site. Samples are preserved in ethanol in the field and shipped to a contracting lab for analysis. For additional details, see the user guide, protocols, science design, and lab SOPs listed in the Documentation section in this data product's details webpage.

Brief Design Description: Benthic macroinvertebrate samples are collected three times per year at wadeable stream, river, and lake sites during aquatic biology bout windows, roughly in spring, summer, and fall. Samples are collected using the most appropriate sampler for the habitat type, including Surber, Hess, hand corer, modified kicknet, D-frame sweep, and petite ponar samplers. In wadeable streams, samples are collected in the two most dominant habitat types (e.g. riffles, runs, pools, step pools). In lakes, samples are collected near the buoy, and nearshore sensors using a petite ponar, and in littoral areas using a D-frame sweep. In rivers, samples are collected near the buoy and two other deep-water locations using a petite ponar sampler, and in littoral areas using a D-frame sweep or large-woody debris sampler. Samples are preserved in ethanol in the field, returned to the domain support facility for a preservative change where a small volume of glycerol is added to help keep invertebrates from getting brittle. Samples are shipped to a taxonomy lab for sorting and identification, including count of each taxon per size class (to nearest mm) and identification to lowest practical taxon (genus or species).

ISSUE LOG
----------

This log provides a list of issues that were identified during data collection or processing, prior to publication of this data package. For a more recent log, please visit this data product's detail page at https://data.neonscience.org/data-products/DP1.20120.001.

Issue Date: 2022-09-13
Issue: Toolik Field Station required a quarantine period prior to starting work in the 2020, 2021, and 2022 field seasons to protect all personnel during the COVID-19 pandemic. This complicated NEON field scheduling logistics, which typically involves repeated travel across the state on short time frames. Consequently, NEON reduced staff traveling to Toolik and was thus unable to complete all planned sampling efforts. Missed data collection events are indicated in data records via the samplingImpractical field.
       Date Range: 2020-03-23 to 2022-12-31
       Location(s) Affected: OKSR, TOOK
Resolution Date: 
Resolution: 

Issue Date: 2022-09-13
Issue: Severe flooding destroyed several roads into Yellowstone National Park in June 2022, making the YELL and BLDE sites inaccessible to NEON staff. Observational data collection was halted during this time. Canceled data collection events are indicated in data records via the samplingImpractical field.
       Date Range: 2022-06-12 to 2022-12-31
       Location(s) Affected: BLDE
Resolution Date: 
Resolution: 

Issue Date: 2022-11-15
Issue: Incorrect namedlocation: The incorrect named location was published for littoral surface water, biological, and sediment sampling at Toolik Lake.
       Date Range: 2017-01-01 to 2022-10-20
       Location(s) Affected: TOOK
Resolution Date: 2022-10-20
Resolution: Data collected in this data product through the resolution date with **namedLocation** equal to TOOK.AOS.littoral1 was edited to equal TOOK.AOS.littoral3.

Issue Date: 2021-05-26
Issue: Duplicated field data: Records in `inv_fieldData` are published in duplicate for all aquatic sites for 2014-2019 due to a publishing error. These will be fixed for the 2022 release
       Date Range: 2014-07-01 to 2019-12-01
       Location(s) Affected: All Aquatic Sites
Resolution Date: 2022-01-20
Resolution: Duplicates removed from field data table and published with the 2022 data release.

Issue Date: 2021-01-06
Issue: Safety measures to protect personnel during the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in reduced or canceled sampling activities for extended periods at NEON sites. Data availability may be reduced during this time.
       Date Range: 2020-03-23 to 2021-12-31
       Location(s) Affected: All
Resolution Date: 2021-12-31
Resolution: The primary impact of the pandemic on observational data was reduced data collection. Training procedures and data quality reviews were maintained throughout the pandemic, although some previously in-person training was conducted virtually.  Scheduled measurements and sampling that were not carried out due to COVID-19 or any other causes are indicated in data records via the samplingImpractical data field.

Issue Date: 2021-12-09
Issue: State-level taxa obfuscation: Prior to the 2022 data release, publication of species identifications were obfuscated to a higher taxonomic rank when the taxon was found to be listed as threatened, endangered, or sensitive at the state level where the observation was recorded. Obfuscating state-listed taxa has created challenges for data users studying biodiversity.
       Date Range: 2012-01-01 to 2021-12-31
       Location(s) Affected: All
Resolution Date: 2021-12-31
Resolution: The state-level obfuscation routine was removed from the data publication process at all locations excluding sites located in D01 and D20. Data have been reprocessed to remove the obfuscation of state-listed taxa. Federally listed threatened and endangered or sensitive species remain obfuscated at all sites and sensitive species remain redacted at National Park sites.

Issue Date: 2020-10-20
Issue: Inlet Outlet Names: Near-shore sampling locations in all lake sites were named 'inlet' and 'outlet' even if the site was a seepage lake that has no single inlet or outlet.
       Date Range: 2014-07-01 to 2020-12-31
       Location(s) Affected: BARC, CRAM, LIRO, PRLA, PRPO, SUGG, TOOK
Resolution Date: 2020-12-31
Resolution: Near-shore collection sites at seepage lakes are now called 'littoral1' and 'littoral2', where 'littoral1' corresponds to previous site name 'inlet' and 'littoral2' corresponds to previous site name 'outlet'.

Issue Date: 2018-12-10
Issue: Taxonomic synonomy
       Date Range: 2018-11-01 to 2018-12-10
       Location(s) Affected: All aquatic sites
Resolution Date: 2018-12-10
Resolution: As of November 2018, taxonomists at EcoAnalysts, Inc. began using the scientificName Neoleptophlebia sp. This genus is a synonym for some members of the genus Paraleptophlebia (Tiunova and Kluge 2016). Neoleptophlebia sp. is more common in NEON samples than Paraleptophlebia sp.

Issue Date: 2020-10-20
Issue: No Standard Taxonomic Effort: External taxonomy labs not using standard taxonomic effort
       Date Range: 2014-07-01 to 2018-01-01
       Location(s) Affected: All Aquatic Sites
Resolution Date: 2018-01-01
Resolution: External labs began using standardized taxonomic effort for identification targets, references, and measurement.


ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
----------------------

Protection of species of concern: At most sites, taxonomic IDs of species of concern have been 'fuzzed', i.e., reported at a higher taxonomic rank than the raw data, to avoid publishing locations of sensitive species. For a few sites with stricter regulations (e.g., Great Smoky Mountains National Park (GRSM)), records for species of concern are not published. 

Queries for this data product will return all data for `inv_fieldData`, `inv_persample`, and `inv_taxonomyProcessed` during the date range specified. If sampling is not impractical, each record for in `inv_fieldData` will have one corresponding record in `inv_persample`, and may have multiple corresponding records in `inv_taxonomyRaw` and `inv_taxonomyProcessed`, one record for each scientificName and sizeClass combination. A record from `inv_fieldData` may have multiple or no records in `inv_perVial`, as that table represents individuals removed from the final archived sample and placed in the external lab's in-house reference collection, records in this table are opportunistic. The expanded package also returns raw taxonomic data from the external taxonomist in `inv_taxonomyRaw` and information on the contents of the vial sent to the archive facility in `inv_perVial`. Duplicates may exist where protocol and/or data entry aberrations have occurred; users should check data carefully for anomalies before analyzing data. Taxonomic IDs of species of concern have been 'fuzzed'; see data package readme files for more information.
