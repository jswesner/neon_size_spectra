############################ Working on
Junker
Implement metabolism model demo for one site

Wesner
Modeled fish abundance with 3 pass
If passes one or two had 0, then fish was just the sum of passes 1,2,3 (following McGarvey et al. 2018)
Used rfishbase to get length weight regressions for every collection
Preliminary plot looks promising

Pomeranz


############################ Next steps
Wesner
Check the units of fish mass (is it dry mass? Are some length measures in cm or are all in mm?)
