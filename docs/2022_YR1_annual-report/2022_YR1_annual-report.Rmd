### Accomplishments

#### What are the major goals of this project?

The main goal of this project is to discern the role of temperature and resource supply on energy transfer through stream food webs of the National Ecological Observation Network (NEON). There is a common pattern across ecosystems in which organism abundance (*N*) declines with increasing body mass (*M*). The shape of this relationship is described by a power law, $N ~ M^b$, known as the abundance size-spectrum and the exponent, *b*, varies in relation to changes in energy flow through food webs and ecosystems. Warming temperatures are expected to alter ecosystem size-spectra, yet, experimental and observational research has shown varied effects (e.g., positive, negative, and neutral). Further, the transfer of energy from basal resources to higher trophic levels may also be influenced by the amount of resources available, as this sets the limits on the biomass an ecosystem can potentially support. Therefore, the proposed work will quantify the natural variation in the size-spectra of streams across broad geographical areas represented by NEON sites and test the hypothesis that *b* scales with temperature and resource supply.

```

We will accomplish this goal through a number of objectives. We will:

1) **Characterize the relationship between abundance and body size, $N ~ M^b$, in the macroinvertebrate and fish communities of NEON streams**

We will develop standardized protocols and methods to characterize spatiotemporal variability in NEON stream community size-spectra. The size-spectra literature is composed of varied methods for calculating *b* from community data--up to 16 different types of size spectra. These include multiple binning methods, pre-analysis normalization, biomass spectra, etc. and there exists no straightforward transformation among methods. This variation in methodologies hinders the ability for synthesis and drawing broader conclusions from the existing literature. In this project, we will estimate *b* using a standardized approach employing maximum likelihood estimation, a method that does not require binning thereby providing an unbiased estimate of *b*.

Additionally, underlying the uncertainty in how size spectra relate to temperature and resource supply is an incomplete characterization of the natural variation in size spectra over space and time. Due to the large logistical efforts needed to collect, identify, count, and measure 1000's or 10000's of individuals for a single size spectrum, studies are limited to a small number of replicates and typically a single sample per site. We will leverage the sampling infrastructure of NEON, which conducts multiple sampling campaigns at each site annually, to better characterize the background variation in size spectra. We will analyze the biological data from these campaigns using a standardized approach. Further, we will develop an open-source package in the R statistical computing environment to help other researchers to estimate *b* using our standardized approach, reducing the barriers for future syntheses.

2) **Characterize the temperature regimes of NEON streams**

We will develop statistical frameworks to characterize and summarize the temperature regimes of NEON streams. The water temperature data across NEON streams varies in length of record and completeness. We will develop workflows which allow us to characterize the water temperature regimes annually and account for missing values by integrating air temperature record.

3) **Quantifying resource availability in NEON streams**

We will quantify the supply of basal resources to consumers across NEON stream ecosystems. Basal resource supply provides the energetic base which feeds higher trophic levels and therefore sets limits on the biomass and trophic levels ecosystems can support. In addition to the macroinvertebrate and fish sampling, NEON also maintains routine sampling of other ecological variables and network of sensors allowing for the quantification of both autochthonous and allochthonous basal resources availability. To quantify autochthonous resources we will take advantage of the sensor network's data streams of continuous dissolved oxygen, stream stage, discharge, and temperature to estimate ecosystem metabolism. To quantify allochthonous resources, we will build a metric of allochthonous inputs that takes into account canopy cover as a proxy for terrestrial inputs. Together, gross primary production and terrestrial inputs make up the total energetic base fueling production and the maintenance of biomass from primary to tertiary consumers.

#### What was accomplished under these goals (you must provide information for at least one of the 4 categories below)?

##### Major activities:

Through the past year we have made strides towards all three stated objectives. We anticipate further refinements to be accomplished over the following year, as well as, substantive progress addressing the quantification of resource availability among NEON streams.

We have developed the workflow and statistical framework to combined the NEON macroinvertebrate and fish assemblage data in comparable units, allowing us to develop multi-trophic size spectra in all streams (Figure 2). This procedure is updated upon new data releases by NEON (approximately semi-annually).

We have also developed and 

##### Specific objectives:

##### Significant results:

To date, we have completed initial analyses of the relationship between multi-trophic size scaling relationships, i.e. *b*, and mean annual water temperature across NEON streams. These analyses suggest temperature--when viewed in isolation--has a negative relationship with the size spectra scaling exponent with an 88% probability. Yet, the magnitude of the temperature effect in the preliminary analysis is small at -0.002 units (-0.006--0.002 95% credibility interval [CI]), corresponding to an estimated decline in *b* from -1.29 to -1.33 across the 22$^/circ$C gradient. Compared to the among sample variation of -1.13 to -1.82, the temperature effect is relatively small in relation to within-site variability. 

We have also completed initial analyses of the relationship between macroinvertebrate and fish biomass and stream temperature. Theory suggests community biomass should exhibit a negative relationship between standing biomass and temperature due to increased metabolic demands of consumers. However, initial analyses suggest a neutral relationship and, in the case of macroinvertebrates, a 94% percent probability of a positive relatioship between community biomass and temperature. 

Together, the weak negative relationship between size spectra scaling exponent and temperature and the unexpected neutral-to-positive relationship between community biomass and temperature leave open the potential for resource supply to play an important role in mediating multi-trophic size spectra.
